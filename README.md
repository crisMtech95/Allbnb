## What is Allbnb?

 As you might deduce from the name, Allbnb is a full stack clone of Airbnb with the very important difference that users are able to lease or lend any type of item that you might need for a trip. Need a place to stay?, a car? or camping gear for your trip?, Allbnb is the place where you can find all those items for a specific location. 
 
 ## Project Structure Overview
 
 The backend of this app was built using Python and Flask integrated SQLAchemy to interconnect with a postgreql database. React and Redux allow for smart management of data and components rerenders and continous navigation without the need of a page refreash. The RESTful API was design in harmony with the redux store to display on the page any change that the user might cause to the database.
